# Daily-Temperatures
Solution for "Leetcode 739. Daily Temperatures"

# Description 

This Python code is an implementation of an algorithm to find the number of days one needs to wait after a given day to experience a warmer temperature. It takes an array of daily temperatures as input and returns an array where each element corresponds to the number of days one must wait after the corresponding day to encounter a temperature higher than the current day's temperature. If there's no future day with a warmer temperature, the corresponding element in the output array is set to 0.
